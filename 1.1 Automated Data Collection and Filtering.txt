Step 1: Collecting Data
1.1 Define Data Sources
Social Media: Twitter (via API), Reddit, YouTube comments.
News Websites: Use RSS feeds or scrape news aggregators (Google News, Bing News).
Public Records: Government websites and databases.
Others: Blogs, forums, and specific topic-driven websites.
1.2 Implement Data Collection Pipelines
APIs

Twitter API (Tweepy), Reddit API (PRAW), Google News API.
Fetch structured data directly via RESTful APIs.
Web Scraping

Use Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, or Selenium for dynamic content.
Respect robots.txt and avoid IP bans with rate limiting and proxies.
Real-Time Streaming

Kafka: Ingest real-time data streams.
WebSockets: Fetch live data from sources like stock markets or breaking news APIs.
Storing Data

Raw Data Storage: MongoDB, Elasticsearch, or CSV/JSON files for unstructured data.
Structured Data Storage: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
Deliverables
A functional pipeline for data collection from chosen sources.
A repository of raw, unprocessed data stored in a database or flat files.
Step 2: Preparing the Data
2.1 Cleaning Data
Remove irrelevant tags, duplicates, special characters, or ads using Beautiful Soup or Python libraries.
Handle missing data:
Imputation (if critical) or removal of incomplete rows.
2.2 Text Preprocessing
Tokenisation: Split text into words or phrases (NLTK, SpaCy).
Lowercasing: Standardise text for uniformity.
Stopword Removal: Filter out common words (e.g., "the", "is").
Lemmatization: Convert words to base forms using SpaCy or NLTK.
Language Detection: Use LangDetect or FastText to filter non-relevant languages.
2.3 Feature Engineering
Text Features:
Extract TF-IDF scores or word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT).
Metadata Features:
Timestamps, source domains, or language as additional features.
Deliverables
Cleaned datasets, ready for model training.
Feature matrices (numerical representations of text data).
Step 3: Choosing Multiple Models
3.1 Criteria for Model Selection
Compatibility: Models should use the same input format (e.g., feature matrix from TF-IDF or embeddings).
Flexibility: Algorithms should support text classification and topic modelling.
3.2 Models to Test
Classical ML Models

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Deep Learning Models

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for text
Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)
Unsupervised Models

K-Means for clustering.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling.
Deliverables
Shortlisted models compatible with the prepared dataset.
Step 4: Training the Models
4.1 Train-Test Split
Divide the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets.
Use stratified sampling if the dataset is imbalanced.
4.2 Train Models
Use frameworks:
Scikit-learn: For Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: For LSTMs, CNNs, and Transformers.
Training parameters:
Batch size, learning rate, epochs for deep learning models.
Use GPU acceleration (if applicable).
Deliverables
Trained models stored for evaluation.
Logs of training metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).
Step 5: Evaluating the Models
5.1 Metrics
Classification Metrics:
Precision, Recall, F1-Score for relevance filtering.
Accuracy for binary or multi-class tasks.
Clustering/Topic Modelling:
Silhouette Score for clusters.
Coherence Score for topics.
5.2 Cross-Validation
Perform K-Fold Cross-Validation for consistent evaluation.
Deliverables
Comparative performance report of all models.
Plots showing metric trends (e.g., confusion matrices, ROC curves).
Step 6: Parameter Tuning
6.1 Hyperparameter Optimisation
Classical ML Models:
GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV in Scikit-learn.
Tune regularisation parameters, kernel types, etc.
Deep Learning Models:
Use Optuna or custom scripts for learning rate, hidden units, dropout rates.
Perform early stopping to avoid overfitting.
Deliverables
Models with optimised hyperparameters.
Logs showing improvements after tuning.
Step 7: Making Predictions
7.1 Apply Models
Use the trained models to predict on unseen datasets.
Format predictions (e.g., category labels, clusters, or summaries).
7.2 Post-Processing
Aggregate results for easier interpretation.
Store predictions in the database for querying.
Deliverables
Predictions stored in a structured format.
Summaries or categories generated for final evaluation.
Step 8: Selecting the Best Model for Deployment
8.1 Model Comparison
Compare all models based on:
Accuracy and other performance metrics.
Inference speed and resource usage.
8.2 Deployment Readiness
Export the selected model in a deployable format (e.g., ONNX, Pickle).
Test the model in a mock production environment.
Deliverables
Best-performing model ready for deployment.
Deployment checklist (e.g., input validation, scalability).
